11:29:41 : Group: Neverwhere: Seriously though, who in their right mind puts a minigun on an SUV?
11:30:11 : Group: Neverwhere: That's like a piece of the american dream happening on the reality show "red jacket" right there >_>
11:30:28 : Group: Neverwhere: Wait, armored, minigun wielding SUVs are a real thing?
11:30:37 : Group: Neverwhere: It's a gun-smithing reality show
11:30:56 : Group: Neverwhere: I did not know that. I still find it dumb. 
11:31:38 : Group: Neverwhere: They had this episode where they dualmounted 2 M240s on a pickup truck
11:31:46 : Group: Neverwhere: it was the dumbest most american shit ever.
11:32:08 : Group: Neverwhere: All it lacked was a bald eagle and a hamburger pasted on the doors.
11:32:14 : Group: Neverwhere: See I knew you'd like it :P
11:32:23 : Group: Neverwhere: :D
11:32:30 : Group: Neverwhere: Yes, yes we are so damn done

14:02:11 : Side: red beret: connor
14:02:14 : Side: red beret: can you start hacking please
14:02:51 : Side: DaBethum: The grass is disabled in order to increase FPS for players with lower end PCs
14:03:12 : Side: ConnorNisbet: aww come on put grass back
14:03:21 : Side: DeniableSummer: that should be a client side setting, not server side
14:03:32 : Side: ConnorNisbet: i agree
14:03:47 : Side: DaBethum: Client side is banned with BattlEye
14:03:57 : Side: DeniableSummer: thats stupid
14:04:00 : Side: DaBethum: We're considering adding it to a script
14:04:07 : Side: ConnorNisbet: it looks shit without grass
14:04:13 : Side: DaBethum: As in, right click on your toolbox to turn it off
14:04:22 : Side: DeniableSummer: that would be nice
14:04:31 : Side: DaBethum: We want the server to be user-friendly
14:04:39 : Side: DeniableSummer: any friendlys at balota?
14:04:45 : Side: ConnorNisbet: put grass back then
14:05:15 : Side: DaBethum: Not any time soon, that's not high on our priorities list
14:05:43 : Side: ConnorNisbet: it should be player want it
14:06:22 : Side: DaBethum: If you paid for or worked on the server it would be of more concern
14:06:30 : Side: DaBethum: But we have weeks worth of coding to handle first
14:06:44 : Side: DeniableSummer: looking for any additions coders?
14:06:50 : Side: DeniableSummer: additional
14:07:01 : Side: ConnorNisbet: a had my owns server ano what people want and dont
14:07:38 : Side: DaBethum: I don't know what you meant with that
14:08:42 : Side: DaBethum: We only consider new coders if they've been on the server awhile
